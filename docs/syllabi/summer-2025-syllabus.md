# Course Requirements

## Text and Materials

Below is a list of the required materials for the course.

**Required Textbook**: APEX Calculus by Gregory Hartman, et al. The course will reference Edition 5 available as an HTML webpage. [Link to APEX Calculus](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-video/chapter_integration.html). Other editions (and texts) are acceptable but be aware of differing section numbers and arrangements of content.  

**Optional Print Copy**: Printed copy of the text is available via online retailers.

**Other Resources**: Readings, recorded video lessons, tutorials, references to other Calculus books and more will be available on the course Blackboard site.  

**Calculators**: Access to a standard graphing calculator is required for homework, exams, and class activities. The [Desmos online scientific calculator](http://www.desmos.com/scientific) and [Desmos online graphing utility](http://www.desmos.com/calculator) will be used for instruction and can be used instead of a physical calculator. 

**Required Text(s) and Technology**: RPNow remote proctoring software may be required for the final exam. Note this requires a computer with iOS or windows, RPNow is NOT supported on a chromebook. A camera is required for uploading solutions to written assignments. Discussion Board will also be used for course communication.  

We will use web-based software for activities, such as Google Sheets, Desmos, and Discussion Board for collaboration. All course information is available on Blackboard.

## Class Participation and Attendance

Full participation is required in this course. Please contact your instructor ahead of time if you cannot participate. Nonparticipation will result in a loss of points on discussion activities.

Participation includes:
* Participating in feedback assignments, discussions, and group activities.
* Completing all assignments and activities on time.

## Instructor Response Time

**Feedback and Communication:**
* Feedback on emails and discussion posts: within one business day during the week.
* Graded assignments: within two weeks of the due date.

## Regular and Substantive Interaction (RSI)

This fully asynchronous course includes substantive interaction through at least two of the following methods each week:
* Direct Instruction
  - Optional Monday and Wednesday Zoom study sessions (12–1 PM)
  - One-on-one appointments upon request
* Assessment and Feedback
  - Personalized feedback on assignments in MyOpenMath
  - Mid-term progress report after Exam #1
* Course Content Support
  - Weekly announcements addressing key concepts and common questions
  - Timely responses to emails and discussion posts (within one business day)
  - Proactive outreach to students who may be struggling
* Discussion Facilitation
  - Active participation in weekly Blackboard discussions
  - Guidance on problem-solving in discussion forums

## Required Written Work

Reading assignments, written solutions, discussion prompts, and survey responses are required in the course.

## Academic Honesty

While working together is encouraged, all submitted work must be your own. Copying, cheating, or plagiarizing will result in a zero for the first offense and a grade of F for the second offense. For more information, see the KPC Support & Policy Guide linked at the end of this syllabus.

# Grading

## Grading Scale and Evaluation

Your final grade will be determined by points earned from participation, homework, written submissions, and a *comprehensive* final exam. Due dates for assignments are firm. Contact me ahead of time if you are having difficulties with finishing assignments on time or if work is expected to be late.

Your grade will be determined out of 390 points. The grade scale is:  
● A (90-100%)  
● B (80-89%)  
● C (70-79%)  
● D (60-69%)  
● F (below 59%)  
   
Final grades are determined by the following percentages.

**Class Participation and Engagement**: 6% of grade (30 points)  
We will use the course Discussion Board for class communications. Full points are awarded for *active engagement and participation*. Questions, responses to questions, and responses to weekly challenges are considered class communication. For full points, a minimum of five class communications are required and must occur at a frequency at most every two weeks of class.

**Chapter Quizzes**: 10% of the grade (50 points)  
Each chapter has a corresponding multiple choice quiz in Blackboard. We will cover chapters 5-8,9,10 for a total of five chapters. Each quiz is worth 5 points.

**Homework**: 20% of grade (100 points)  
Each week selected problems in the Edfinity online homework system must be completed.

**Written Submissions**: 20% of grade (100 points)  
Written submissions to problem sets must be uploaded to the respective Blackboard assignment. Written assignments are typically due at the end of the unit.

**Blackboard Assignments**: 14% of grade (70 points)  
The blackboard assignments (named BB section number) are due on Fridays of each week.

**Final Exam Part 1: Skills Test**: 10% of grade (50 points)  
*Proctored via Honorlock.* One-hour skills test. You will have one hour to complete it in a single session.

**Final Exam Part 2: Concept Exam**: 20% of grade (100 points)  
*Non-proctored.* Three-hour concept exam. You will have three hours to complete it in a single session; due by August 1st, 2025 at 11:59 pm.
