# Revised Professional Descriptions for Calculus 2

## Weekly Module Folder Descriptions

**Week 1: Foundations of Integration**
```
üìä This module introduces the fundamental concepts of antiderivatives, indefinite integration, and the definite integral (Sections 5.1-5.2). You will learn to find antiderivatives, understand their connection to derivatives, and calculate areas under curves. These concepts form the foundation for all subsequent integration techniques and applications in the course.
```

**Week 8: Integration by Parts**
```
üîÑ This module covers integration by parts, a technique for handling integrals with products of functions (Section 6.1). You will learn to identify appropriate scenarios for this method, develop strategies for choosing u and dv, and apply the tabular approach for repeated applications. These skills are essential for solving more complex integration problems in both theoretical and applied contexts.
```

**Week 10: Work & Fluid Forces**
```
‚öôÔ∏è This module examines applications of integration to physical problems (Sections 7.5-7.6). The content focuses on calculating work done by variable forces, analyzing spring systems, determining work required to pump liquids, and computing fluid forces on submerged surfaces. These concepts demonstrate the practical utility of integration in engineering and physics.

## Section Content Folder Descriptions

**Section 6.2: Trigonometric Integrals**
```
üìê This section addresses strategies for integrating trigonometric expressions. The content covers techniques for handling powers of sine and cosine, products of different trigonometric functions, and recognizing special patterns. These methods build on trigonometric identities and substitution techniques to solve integrals that appear frequently in physics, electrical engineering, and signal analysis applications.
```

**Section 7.6: Fluid Forces**
```
üíß This section examines the calculation of forces exerted by fluids on submerged surfaces. The material covers how pressure varies with depth, methods for setting up appropriate integration problems, and techniques for handling different surface orientations. These concepts have direct applications in engineering fields including dam design, tank construction, and hydraulic systems.

## Link Descriptions

**Assignment: Homework 8 - Integration by Parts**
```
üìù This assignment contains 12 integration by parts problems of increasing complexity. You will practice identifying appropriate u and dv selections, applying the formula correctly, and combining integration by parts with other techniques. Multiple attempts are allowed, with your highest score recorded. Due Friday at 11:59 PM. Reference Section 6.1 in the textbook for additional guidance.
```

**Resource: Integration Techniques Flow Chart**
```
üîç This reference chart provides a decision tree for selecting appropriate integration techniques based on integrand form. The chart covers substitution, integration by parts, partial fractions, and trigonometric techniques with characteristic examples of each pattern. Use this resource to develop systematic problem-solving strategies when approaching unfamiliar integrals.
```

**Video: Visualizing the Shell Method**
```
üé¨ This 12-minute video demonstrates the shell method for calculating volumes of revolution. Dr. Johnson works through examples with 3D animations showing how cylindrical shells form the volume. The video includes step-by-step calculations and criteria for determining when to use the shell method versus the disk/washer method for optimal problem-solving.
```

**Textbook: APEX Calculus Section 6.1**
```
üìö This link provides direct access to the textbook's coverage of integration by parts. The section includes the derivation of the formula, detailed examples, explanation of the tabular method for repeated applications, and practice problems with solutions. This material serves as the foundation for this week's assignments and lecture content.
```

**Practice: Midterm Review Problems**
```
‚úèÔ∏è This collection contains 25 practice problems representative of the midterm exam. The problems cover integration techniques (substitution, parts, partial fractions), applications (area, volume, arc length), and conceptual understanding. Solutions are provided for odd-numbered problems with detailed explanations of the solution process and key concepts.
