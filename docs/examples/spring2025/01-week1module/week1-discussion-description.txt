Week 1 Questions and Discussion
Hi all! I am Professor Jeffrey Johnson, teaching this course through the Homer branch of Kenai Peninsula College. I grew up in rural Wisconsin and originally attended the University of Minnesota - Duluth, where I developed a love for mathematics. I later moved to northern California and finished my undergraduate degree at Humboldt State University (now Cal Poly Humboldt). After that, I took a break to serve in the Peace Corps in South Africa for a couple of years, then completed all my graduate work, including my PhD, at the University of Montana in Missoula. I taught there for a year before accepting a position as professor of mathematics at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. After a few years, our family decided to return to Alaska, where my wife is from.



My wife and I have three rambunctious kids who keep very busy and a sweet little dog named Elmo who just wants some peace and quiet.



Please reach out to me with any questions! That is my favorite part of teaching. Welcome!
