Simpson's Rule Error Analysis


Consider the integral



﻿I equals integral subscript 0 superscript 1 e to the power of x squared end exponent d xI equals integral subscript 0 superscript 1 e to the power of x squared end exponent d x﻿



This integral does not have an elementary closed-form antiderivative. However, we can approximate ﻿II﻿ using Simpson's Rule and control the error using the standard error bound.



Let ﻿E subscript SE subscript S﻿ be the error when using Simpson's Rule with ﻿nn﻿ subintervals on ﻿left square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracketleft square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracket﻿. If ﻿f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals e to the power of x squared end exponentf left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals e to the power of x squared end exponent﻿ and ﻿f to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesisf to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesis﻿ is continuous on ﻿left square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracketleft square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracket﻿, then there exists a constant ﻿KK﻿ such that



 ﻿open vertical bar f to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesis close vertical bar less or equal than K space text for all end text space x element of left square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracketopen vertical bar f to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesis close vertical bar less or equal than K space text for all end text space x element of left square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracket﻿



and Simpson's Rule guarantees



﻿open vertical bar E subscript S close vertical bar equals space open vertical bar integral subscript 0 superscript 1 f left parenthesis x right parenthesis d x minus S subscript n close vertical bar less or equal than fraction numerator left parenthesis 1 minus 0 right parenthesis to the power of 5 over denominator 180 n to the power of 4 end fraction K equals fraction numerator K over denominator 180 n to the power of 4 end fraction.open vertical bar E subscript S close vertical bar equals space open vertical bar integral subscript 0 superscript 1 f left parenthesis x right parenthesis d x minus S subscript n close vertical bar less or equal than fraction numerator left parenthesis 1 minus 0 right parenthesis to the power of 5 over denominator 180 n to the power of 4 end fraction K equals fraction numerator K over denominator 180 n to the power of 4 end fraction.﻿



Complete the following:


1. Show that ﻿max with 0 less or equal than x less or equal than 1 below open vertical bar f to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesis close vertical barmax with 0 less or equal than x less or equal than 1 below open vertical bar f to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesis close vertical bar﻿ can be taken as ﻿K equals 76 eK equals 76 e﻿.

  

  *(Hint: Compute ﻿f to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesisf to the power of left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis end exponent left parenthesis x right parenthesis﻿ explicitly and evaluate its maximum on ﻿left square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracketleft square bracket 0 comma 1 right square bracket﻿.)*



2. Determine how large ﻿nn﻿ (an even integer) must be so that the absolute error in approximating ﻿integral subscript 0 superscript 1 e to the power of x squared end exponent d xintegral subscript 0 superscript 1 e to the power of x squared end exponent d x﻿ by Simpson's Rule is at most ﻿10 to the power of negative 4 end exponent10 to the power of negative 4 end exponent﻿.
