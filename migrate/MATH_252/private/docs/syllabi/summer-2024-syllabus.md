# Course Requirements

## Text and Materials

Below is a list of the required materials for the course.

**Required Textbook**: APEX Calculus by Gregory Hartman, et al.  The course will reference Edition 5 available as an HTML webpage.  [Link to APEX Calculus](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-video/chapter_integration.html).  Other editions (and texts) are acceptable but be aware of differing section numbers and arrangements of content.  

**Optional Print Copy**: Printed copy of the text is available via online retailers.

**Other Resources**: Readings, recorded video lessons, tutorials, references to other Calculus books and more will be available on the course Blackboard site.  

**Calculators**: Access to a standard graphing calculator is required for homework, exams, and class activities. The [Desmos online](http://www.desmos.com/scientific\)) [scientific calculator (www.desmos.com/scientific)](http://www.desmos.com/scientific\)) and [Desmos online](http://www.desmos.com/calculator\)) [graphing utility (www.desmos.com/calculator)](http://www.desmos.com/calculator\)) will be used for instruction and can be used instead of a physical calculator. 

**Required Text(s) and Technology:**  RPNow remote proctoring software may be required for the final exam.  Note this requires a computer with iOS or windows, RPNow is NOT supported on a chromebook.  A camera is required for uploading solutions to written assignments.  Discussion Board will also be used for course communication.  

We will use web-based software for activities, such as Google Sheets, Desmos, and Discussion Board for collaboration.  All course information is available on Blackboard.

## Class Participation and Attendance

Full participation is required in this course.  Please contact your instructor ahead of time if you cannot respond to instructor questions or participate for any reason. Nonparticipation will result in a loss of points on discussion activities.

Participation in the course includes:

* Participating in Discussion Board activities and responding to instructor messages and requests.  
* Completing all assignments and activities in the course on time.

## Instructor Response Time

**Feedback and Communication:**  
I am committed to providing you with timely grades and feedback on graded work for  
this class. Feedback to your emails and discussion posts will be given within one day during the week and by Monday if sent over the weekend.  Graded assignments will be available to you within two weeks of the due date.   If you don’t hear from me within this timeframe, try emailing me again. Please be professional in your email correspondence. Ensure you include your full name, the course, and an appropriate subject line. My office phone number is available on the course syllabus and on Blackboard; if I don’t answer, please leave a voice message.

**Regular and Substantive Interaction (RSI):**  
This course is fully asynchronous and has no set meeting times; you will have course activities and due dates throughout the term. I will substantively interact with you through discussion board prompts and responses, also live meetings via Zoom. The time of the work sessions will be determined by the class within the first two weeks of the semester. Regular personal feedback will be provided each week for responses in the Discussion Boards. I will also check-in with each student personally throughout the semester, making sure you are getting the support you need.

## Required Written Work

Reading assignments, discussion prompts, and survey responses are required in the course.

# Academic Honesty

While working together is encouraged in this course, all submitted assignments must be done with your own work. Copying, cheating, or plagiarizing work on an assignment will result in a zero for a first offense. A second offense or cheating on an exam will result in a grade of F for the course.

Academic integrity is a basic principle that requires students to take credit only for ideas and efforts that are their own. Cheating, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty are defined in the Student Code of Conduct which can be found in the [UAA Student Handbook (catalog.uaa.alaska.edu/](https://catalog.uaa.alaska.edu/handbook/student-freedoms-rights-and-responsibilities/student-code-of-conduct/) [handbook/student-freedoms-rights-and-responsibilities/student-code-of-conduct/](https://catalog.uaa.alaska.edu/handbook/student-freedoms-rights-and-responsibilities/student-code-of-conduct/)  
[)](https://catalog.uaa.alaska.edu/handbook/student-freedoms-rights-and-responsibilities/student-code-of-conduct/).

Cheating, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty will first go through the student conduct process and then, if a violation of the Student Code of Conduct is found, academic sanctions may occur in addition to disciplinary sanctions. The Student Conduct Review Procedures are outlined in the UAA Student Handbook.

The Academic Dispute Resolution Procedure is in the [UAA Catalog (catalog.](https://catalog.uaa.alaska.edu/academicpoliciesprocesses/academicstandardsregulations/academicrightsofstudents/)  
[uaa.alaska.edu/academicpoliciesprocesses/academicstandardsregulations/](https://catalog.uaa.alaska.edu/academicpoliciesprocesses/academicstandardsregulations/academicrightsofstudents/)  
[academicrightsofstudents/)](https://catalog.uaa.alaska.edu/academicpoliciesprocesses/academicstandardsregulations/academicrightsofstudents/).

# Grading

## Grading Scale and Evaluation

Your final grade will be determined by points earned from participation, homework, written submissions, and a *comprehensive* final exam. Due dates for assignments are firm. Contact me ahead of time if you are having difficulties with finishing assignments on time or if work is expected to be late.

Your grade will be determined out of 390 points.  The grade scale is:  
●     A (90-100%)  
●     B (80-89%)  
●     C (70-79%)  
●     D (60-69%)  
●     F (below 59%)  
   
Final grades are determined by the following percentages.

**Class Participation and Engagement**: 6% of grade (30 points)  
We will use the course Discussion Board for class communications.  Full points are awarded for *active engagement and participation*.  Questions, responses to questions, and responses to weekly challenges are considered class communication.  For full points, a minimum of five class communications are required and must occur at a frequency at most every two weeks of class.    
**Chapter Quizzes**: 10% of the grade (50 points)  
Each chapter has a corresponding multiple choice quiz in Blackboard.  We will cover chapters 5-8,9,10 for a total of five chapters.  Each quiz is worth 5 points.    
**Homework**: 20% of grade (100 points)  
Each week selected problems in the Edfinity online homework system must be completed.  
**Written Submissions**: 20% of grade (100 points)

Written submissions to problem sets must be uploaded to the respective Blackboard assignment.  Written assignments are typically due at the end of the unit.    
**Blackboard Assignments**: 14% of grade (70 points)The blackboard assignments (named BB section number) are due on Fridays of each week.  
**Final Exam Part 1**: 10% of grade (50 points)  
This portion of the final exam is not proctored and due by August 2nd, 2024\.    
**Final Exam Part 2**: 20% of grade (100 points)  
*The final exam must be proctored.  Remote proctoring will use Honorlock remote proctoring**.***  The Final Exam Part 2 will open Wednesday July 31st and close Friday, August 2nd. It must be taken in a single three hour session.
