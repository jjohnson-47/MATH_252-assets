Please see your department chair for the CCG if necessary.*

The Student Outcomes section of your syllabus must match the official CCG verbatim, though you may add additional outcomes.  These are listed in [CIM](https://nextcatalog.uaa.alaska.edu/courseadmin/) in the “Other Course Specific Learning Outcomes and Assessment Measures'' section.    *   

### Required Text(s) and Technology

*Complete publication information for all materials, including ISBN.  List any technology required for the course such as remote proctoring services software like RPNow (be sure students know Chromebooks do not work with RPNow), math software such as Equatio, and remote desktop software to access specialized applications installed on KPC lab computers.*

### Instructor Response Time 

**Feedback:** *Timely feedback on student work corresponds directly to student success, and the KPC Faculty Forum encourages all KPC instructors to include details about the timeline in which you will make grades and feedback available to students for each type of assignment. Best practices suggest that assignment responses from the instructor should be given within two weeks of the due date.*   
*Example:* I am committed to providing you with timely grades and feedback on graded work for this class. My grades and feedback will be available to you within \[two weeks\] of the due date.   
**Communication:** *The KPC Faculty Forum encourages all KPC instructors to respond to all student communication in a consistent and timely fashion. Please include language in your syllabus that details the best way for students to get in touch with you and the timeline in which you will respond to students when they contact you.*   
*Example:* Email is the best way to get in touch with me. I will respond within \[24 hours, except on the weekends\]. If you don’t hear from me within \[24 hours on a weekday\], try emailing me again. Please be professional in your email correspondence. Be sure that you include your full name, the course, and an appropriate subject line. My office phone number is available on the course syllabus and on Blackboard; if I don’t answer, please leave a voice message.  
**IMPORTANT\! For fully asynchronous classes:**  
If you teach a fully asynchronous class you are required to include an additional [Regular and Substantive Interaction (RSI)](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/academics/office-of-academic-affairs/faculty-development-instructional-support/teaching/pedagogy/rsi.cshtml) statement in your syllabus.  Here’s a sample statement to adapt for your course specifics:  
This course is fully asynchronous and has no set meeting times; you will have course activities and due dates throughout the term.  I will substantively interact with you through regular \[class discussion boards, announcements that provide class feedback and direction, individual feedback on your projects, and optional study sessions\].  *Update the section in brackets based on your course design.* 

### Class Participation and Attendance

*Student’s role in class processes.  Expectations and relationship to grading (note: attendance alone cannot be the basis for an academic grade.* 

### 

### Class Atmosphere and Safety

*Include here your rules about intolerance, ridicule, physical violence, classroom behaviors (such as use of cell phones), field trips, or lab work.*   
*Any lab, studio, or hand-on experimental course must include a list of safety rules and procedures.  Students must also acknowledge that they understand those risks and safety procedures; therefore, you should have them sign a Safety Form appropriate to your space.  Examples for lab, shop, and studio are included in the KPC Faculty Orientation Bb Course and online at the KPC website.*
